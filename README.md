ELSO Speaking Groups


The ELSO Speaking Groups Program, sponsored by the English Language Support Office (ELSO), offers small, one-hour weekly discussions with international graduate students and scholars at Cornell. Every semester, around 100 international students ranging from undergraduates to PhDs and around 20 faculty and staff participate in the program. The program allows international students to make meaningful relationships with faculties and staff at Cornell while improving their English skills.
